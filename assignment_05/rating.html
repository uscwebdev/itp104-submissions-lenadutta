                    <h2>Humm - Blackberry</h2>
            <img src="imgranking/hummbberry.jpg" alt="humm">
            <p>Humm Blackberry kombucha takes the #1 spot in my ranking any day! This flavor is bright, tart, and perfect for the summertime. The specific method of bottling makes the carbonation almost foamy and smooth, unlike a harsh soda or sparkling water. Although it is delicious on its own, it pairs wonderfully with mint and soda water for a summer mocktail. All of Humm's flavors are delicious and highly recommended by me, but if you see this one in store <em>definitely</em> give it a try. Humm Kombuchas are also naturally flavored and have no added sugars!</p>

            <h3>Better Booch - Prickly Pear</h3>
            <img src="imgranking/betterboochpp.jpeg" alt="better booch">
            <p>The #2 spot for my favorite Kombucha goes to Better Booch's prickly pear. Better Booch kombuchas are delightfully tasty with a wide range of fun flavors such as this one. Taking a sip of the prickly pear flavor feels just like biting into a juicy pear on a hot summer day. It is light, fruity, and perfectly sweet. I prefer to enjoy my Better Booches over a tall glass of ice with a squeeze of lemon or lime. With flavors ranging from guava cooler to peach iced tea, there is a Better Booch for everyone!</p>

            <h3>Health Ade - Pink Lady Apple</h3>
            <img src="imgranking/healthadepl.jpeg" alt="health ade">
            <p>The number 3 spot goes to a timeless classic - Health Ade's Pink Lady Apple kombucha. Health Ade kombuchas are deliciously sweet, with that recognizable kombucha carbonation you just can't find in anything else. This flavor is a great one to start with if you are new to the world of Kombucha and want something milder and sweeter. If trying kombucha for the first time, I recommend picking up a bottle of this Health Ade flavor and diluting it with a splash of water and pouring over ice. You won't regret it!</p>

            <h3>Brew Dr. - Clear Mind</h3>
            <img src="imgranking/brewdrcm.jpg" alt="brew dr">
            <p>In 4th place is Brew. Dr's Clear Mind kombucha. This kombucha is perfect for those who don't love fruity drinks and prefer a more herbal or sophisticated flavor. The blend of rosemary, mint, sage, and green tea is both calming and delicious. While I don't always reach for this flavor, it is perfect when I am not craving something super sweet but still want something fun to drink.</p>

            <h3>Lion Heart - Ginger</h3>
            <img src="imgranking/lheartg.jpeg" alt="lion heart">
            <p>In 5th place (which is still a high ranking given the amount of kombuchas I have tried) is Lion Heart's ginger flavor. Again, this is a great choice for someone who does not love super fruity or sweet drinks. Lion Heart's kombuchas are very dry, almost similar to a beer. They are very unique compared to most other kombuchas and make for a great non-alcoholic substitute. If you are more adventurous, give this a try for sure!</p>
