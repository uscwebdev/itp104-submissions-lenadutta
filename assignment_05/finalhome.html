            <h2>What is Kombucha?</h2>
            <p>
                Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage that has been consumed for thousands of years. It is made by fermenting sweetened tea with the help of a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, often referred to as a SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) or "kombucha mother." The SCOBY metabolizes the sugar in the tea, producing various organic acids, vitamins, enzymes, and carbon dioxide.
            </p>
            <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
            <p> Probiotics: Kombucha is believed to contain live bacteria and yeast that may contribute to a healthy gut microbiome. Probiotics are known to support digestive health and may help maintain a balanced gut flora.</p>

            <p>Digestive Health: Some individuals report improved digestion and relief from gastrointestinal issues such as bloating, gas, and constipation after consuming kombucha regularly. However, the specific effects may vary between individuals.
            </p>
             <p>
                Antioxidants: Kombucha contains various antioxidants, such as polyphenols, which can help protect the body against oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Antioxidants are associated with potential anti-inflammatory effects and may have a positive impact on overall health.</p>   
                
        
               <p>
                Detoxification: Kombucha is often touted for its potential detoxifying properties. While research on this specific aspect is limited, the antioxidant compounds in kombucha may help in reducing oxidative damage and supporting the body's natural detoxification processes.</p>
